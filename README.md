# Structured Use Case Editor

**A lightweight reference implementation for creating structured use case diagrams and specifications.**

The Structured Use Case Editor is an open-source reference implementation for exploring and validating the **Structured Use Cases** approach.

It provides a browser-based environment for creating use case diagrams, editing structured use case specifications, working with basic, alternate, and exception scenarios, and examining the resulting model in both JSON and UCML textual forms.

The editor is intentionally deployment-neutral. The user interface is implemented with static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. A small cPanel/Passenger Python deployment example is included, but it is not required to run or host the editor.

## Why This Editor Exists

Structured use cases are intended to make behavioral modeling more explicit and useful by describing not only the normal flow of behavior, but also valid alternatives and exception conditions.

The editor provides a practical environment for experimenting with that model and its editing workflow before integration with SysML v2 modeling tools.

It is intended to help validate:

- The Structured Use Cases model
- Use case diagram editing
- Structured scenario editing
- Alternate and exception behavior
- Branch and rejoin references
- JSON model interchange
- UCML textual notation
- Document-oriented views of structured use case specifications

The editor should be viewed as a **reference implementation and experimentation environment**, not as a replacement for a full SysML v2 modeling tool.

## Features

The current implementation includes:

- Use case diagram editing
- Actor and use case nodes
- Association relationships
- Include relationships
- Extend relationships
- Invoke relationships
- Precedes relationships
- Use case specification editing
- Basic/nominal scenarios
- Alternate scenarios
- Exception scenarios
- Branch and rejoin step references
- Generated document preview
- JSON model view
- UCML textual notation view

## Structured Use Case Concepts

A structured use case describes system behavior as scenarios composed of ordered steps.

A use case can contain:

- A **Basic Scenario** describing the normal behavior
- **Alternate Scenarios** describing valid variations
- **Exception Scenarios** describing error conditions or other off-nominal behavior

Making these paths explicit can help engineers discover requirements that may be missed when only the nominal behavior is modeled.

The Structured Use Case Editor provides an interactive environment for creating and examining these structures.

## Relationship to the Structured Use Cases SysML v2 Library

This editor is a companion reference implementation for the **Structured Use Cases SysML v2 library**.

The library defines the modeling concepts for representing structured use cases in SysML v2. This editor provides a lightweight environment for experimenting with those concepts and the associated editing workflow.

The two projects are intended to complement one another:

**Structured Use Cases library -> semantic model**

**Structured Use Case Editor -> reference editing environment**

## JSON and UCML

The editor supports two complementary representations of its model.

### JSON

The JSON view represents the full editor interchange format, including information used by the editor such as diagram layout.

### UCML

UCML provides a human-readable textual notation for the semantic use case model.

The editor can therefore be used to explore the relationship between an interactive graphical editing experience, structured use case semantics, and textual model representations.

## Running Locally

The application is self-contained and does not require npm or third-party Python packages.

From the repository root, run:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

You can also serve the repository root with any static web server.

## Repository Contents

The current application consists of:

Key files:

- `standalone.html` - editor HTML shell
- `standalone-app.js` - browser-based editor implementation
- `src/styles.css` - editor styling
- `app.py` - small deployment-neutral local static-file server
- `images/structured-use-case-editor.png` - README screenshot
- `deployment/cpanel/app.py` - lightweight Python WSGI/static-file server for cPanel-style hosting
- `deployment/cpanel/passenger_wsgi.py` - cPanel/Passenger startup file
- `deployment/cpanel/replacement_passenger_wsgi.py` - replacement startup file if cPanel overwrites the Passenger entry point
- `deployment/cpanel/README.md` - optional cPanel deployment notes

## Deployment

The editor is deployment-neutral and can be hosted as static files.

The cPanel/Passenger files in `deployment/cpanel/` are provided only as one example Python deployment for hosts that require a WSGI application.

## Project Status

The Structured Use Case Editor is a reference implementation under active development and evaluation.

Its purpose is to support experimentation with structured use case modeling, editing workflows, model interchange, and textual notation.

Interfaces, file formats, and modeling details may evolve as the Structured Use Cases approach is refined.

## Contributing

Feedback, testing, and experimentation are welcome.

Useful contributions include:

- Reporting editor defects
- Testing different structured use case examples
- Suggesting usability improvements
- Testing JSON interchange
- Experimenting with UCML
- Improving documentation
- Contributing test cases

## About Structured Use Cases

Structured Use Cases is an effort to make use case modeling simpler, more rigorous, and more useful throughout systems and software engineering.

The central idea is straightforward:

**Describe what normally happens. Describe what else can happen. Describe what can go wrong. Then test all of it.**
